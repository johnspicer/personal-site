    "content2": "The app allows users to login, see a geolocated list of nearby partner stores, and purchase a gift for a homeless person at any of them. The store will then be notified and the gift can be redeemed upon collection, when payment will be taken. It is built using React Native, with Google Firebase as the backend. Payments are handled using Stripe. The project delivered a feature complete prototype, available for testing on the App Store/Google Play",

He used a mixture of technologies both familiar and new to him to ensure we had the best product possible. John is really easy to communicate with which is vital for any successful project, and we hope we can work with him again in future.",

Profiles can then be searched for and donors can verify profiles to build trust on the platform. It's built as a Django app, with HTML/CSS and JS frontend. I have managed all the development, testing and deployment to both staging and production. It is currently running on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.",

It uses an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest route from one item to the next, and shows hotspots of busy warehouse traffic so this can be accounted for. It had to be cross platform, so I used Electron and wrote the UI in React and the logic in Javascript.",
