    "content2": "The app allows users to login, see a geolocated list of nearby partner stores, and purchase a gift for homeless person at any of them. The store will then be notified and the gift can be redeemed upon collection, when payment will be taken. It is built using React Native, with Google Firebase as the backend. Payments are handled using Stripe. The project delivered a feature complete prototype, available for testing on the App Store/Google Play",

Profiles can then be searched for and donors can verify profiles to build trust on the platform. It's built as a Django app, with HTML/CSS and JS frontend.

It uses an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest route from one item to the next, and shows hotspots of busy warehouse traffic so this can be accounted for.
